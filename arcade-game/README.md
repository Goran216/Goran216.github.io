Arcade Game
===============================

## Introduction
This game was made on May/2018 as a part of my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree at Udacity. The main point of making this is to practice my **object-oriented** programming skills with JavaScript, mainly using class functions. It's also worth mentioning that it was my first time i use canvas and it was quite fun.

## How to play
1. Open the index.html file.
2. Try to cross the street/path without colliding with the bugs/enemies.
3. Use up, down, left and right keys to move the player.

## Upcoming updates
I am planning to add new features soon, like adding Gems and having different characters to choose as a player.
