<h4>Extracting insights and actionable information from data requires a broad array of technology that can work with data efficiently, scalably, and cost-effectively. AWS offers a comprehensive set of services to handle every step of the analytics process chain including data warehousing, business intelligence, batch processing, stream processing, machine learning, and data workflow orchestration. These services are powerful, flexible, and yet simple to use, enabling organizations to put their raw data to work quickly and easily. </h4>
  <h4>One of the very great services that AWS provides is Apache hadoop.
    So i will go ahead and install Hadoop for analyzing all the data we have at this financial instition. It enables me to flexibly manipulate and analyze the data. It is very powerful and won't even slow down while working on huge data which is a very good point for our financial institution because we are working on huge data.
