## Introduction

This is a game made by me ([Goran Jawdat](http://goran.xyz)) on April/2018 as part of my Front-End Web Development Nanodegree program at Udacity.

The project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. However, the main point of the project is to practice my Javascript skills.

PS; Font Awesome is used to display the icons
